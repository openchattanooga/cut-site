          <h1>Join us, be a tester</h1>
          <p>The Chattanooga Civic User Testing (CUT) Group is a set of regular Chattanoogans who get paid to test out civic apps.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fill out a CUT Group profile, sign up to be a tester, and you'll get a $5 VISA gift card.</li>
            <li>If and when you are chosen to participate in a testing session, you'll get paid a $20 VISA gift card</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We all know that Chattanooga is an amazing place, but there is always room for improvement. There is a growing community of "civic hackers" - designers, coders, and everyday citizens - building websites, apps and other tools to make life better here in town. At the same time, folks in City Hall want to improve your experience of filling out a form or finding information on a city website.</p>
          <p>The problem is that it is hard for these groups to escape their desks, get out into the streets and get feedback from regular Chattanoogans.</p>
          <p><strong>You're going to change that!</strong></p>
          <p>We need people like you from all over Chattanooga to help us test civic apps so that we can make them easier to use and make everyday living in Chattanooga even better!</p>
          How it Works:
          <ol>
            <li>You fill out a form, answering questions that help us better understand who you are.</li>
            <li>You get a $5 VISA Gift Card</li>
            <li>We send you opportunities to test civic apps</li>
            <li>You come test out a civic app</li>
            <li>You get a $20 VISA Gift Card for each testing session you attend</li>
          </ol>

            <h1>About the CUT Group</h1>
          </a>
          <p>It is common in the technology world to develop products in an iterative fashion, with tight feedback loops from users. The goal is to build an application in close concert with user feedback so that valuable development time isn't used making something that doesn't provide value.</p>
          <p>The infrastructure and resources required to complete user testing sessions are often overlooked, specifically the significant time and know­how involved in the recruitment of testing subjects and conducting of sessions. The idea behind the Chattanooga Civic User Testing (CUT) Group is to remove as many of these barriers as possible and to provide the community with resources to easily solicit and gather user feedback. The CUT group will be a standing group available for any civic application developer or City Hall employee through Open Chattanooga.</p>
          <p>We strive to ensure that the composition of the group reflects a representative sample of Chattanooga, across a variety of factors such as socioeconomics, age, race, digital literacy and access. In order to ensure that we can recruit participants from all corners of Chattanooga, and to recognize the value of their time, testers will be paid with VISA gift cards upon signing up as well as completing a testing session.</p>
          <p>The project is based on the <a href="http://cutgroup.smartchicagoapps.org">Civic User Testing group from the Smart Chicago Collaborative</a>, and is supported by a grant from the Benwood Foundation. The project is a collaboration between the Mayor's Office, Open Chattanooga, and the Code for America fellows.</p>
